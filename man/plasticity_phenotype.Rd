\usage{
plasticity_phenotype(
  means = means,
  first_mean_indices_column = first_mean_indices_column,
  feature_order = feature_order,
  grouping_var = grouping_var,
  group_select = group_select,
  indices_colors = indices_colors,
  sums_colors = sums_colors
)
}
\arguments{
\item{means}{A data frame with the first column containing group labels and the remaining columns containing the average values of each significant plasticity feature across all groups; this function requires all sums to be grouped together and all indices to be grouped together. Note: Features that describe variable sums must precede features that describe variable indices (e.g. sums = columns 2-4, indices = columns 5 â€“ 10).}

\item{first_mean_indices_column}{Numerical value indicating the column number that marks the first feature index (plotted as green-yellow-red); all feature columns before this should be feature sums (plotted as grey-black).}

\item{feature_order}{Numeric vector that describes the order of features to be plotted. The order of values in the vector represent the column numbers for each feature (c(1,3,4,5,2,6,7)). Default order is taken from the data matrix.}

\item{grouping_var}{X-axis title. Default is "Experimental Conditions".}

\item{group_select}{Numberic vector that restricts the phenotype to plot only a subset of group phenotypes. Groups phenotypes to be plotted are indicated using their row numbers (c(1,3,2,4). Default order taken from means dataframe row number (C(1,2,3,4)), unless groups are assigned as factor.}

\item{indices_colors}{Character vector containing the color codes for indices color palette. Order is low, middle, high. Default is c("red", "yellow", "green").}

\item{sums_colors}{Character vector containing the color codes for sums color palette. Order is low, middle, high. Default is c( "#d3d3d3","grey","black").}
}
\value{
Plots phenotype for each group. Stores object plasticity.cols in your Global Environment. This object will be consulted using the phenotype_boxplots function for each feature across each group.
}
\description{
Plots a series of stacked, colour-coded horizontal bars for each group. Color of each bar represents the group mean for the designated feature. Produces a phenotype for each group. Note: For all arguments matrix column numbers are identified as N-1 (e.g. column 4 is indexed as 3).
