Description: Package contains four functionsfor creating phenotypes. The first (identify basis vectors) identifies basis vectors that contain significant amount of cumulative variance in PCA. 
    The second (plot basis vectors) plots the amplotudes of each variable about the PCA basis vectors identified using IdentifyBasisVectors.  
    The third (FeatureMatrix) allows the user to create new features and test whether they are correlated with the basis vectors in PCA.
    The fourth (Plasticity Phenotype) creates a color coded matrix of staacked horizontal bars representign the group averages for each feature identified in Feature Matrix.
