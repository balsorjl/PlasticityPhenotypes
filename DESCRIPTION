Description: Package contains four functions which work towards determining a plasticity phenotype. The first (cum_var) identifies basis vectors that contain a specified amount of cumulative variance in PCA. 
    The second (amplitude_plots) plots the amplitudes of each variable about the PCA basis vectors identified using cum_var.  
    The third (feature_matrix) allows the user to create new features and test whether they are correlated with the basis vectors in PCA.
    The fourth (plasticity_phenotype) creates a color-coded matrix of stacked horizontal bars representign the group averages for each feature identified in feature_matrix.
